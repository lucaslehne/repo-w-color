<h1>Hello There</h1>
<div id="General-Kenobi"> The goal of my final project was to demonstrate how song and music can elevate meaning and emotions in a film.  In the film, “In the Mood for Love”, the main characters were torn between their feelings of love for each other and their morals and values, with an emphasis on their commitment to their Chinese cultural norms.  For my final project, I created a song that cultivates the undertones of the film and reinforces the idea of how music and song in films can enhance meaning and emotion. Throughout all of the films that we viewed in class, music seemed to be a prominent component that enriched the story and helped set the tone for the audience to connect with the characters or scenes. The purpose of my project was to create a new experience, through music and song, that allows others to appreciate the influence that music and song have on the greater meaning of films.
